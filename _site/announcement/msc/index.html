<h1>Announcement - MSC 2023</h1>
<div><p>Dear Aspiring Physicists,</p>
<p>Are you passionate about physics and is it something that electrifies you? If yes, then we have some exhilarating news for you! We are thrilled to announce the most awaited event of the physics club 'Model Solvay Conference 2023'.</p>
<p>Model Solvay Conference is a national-level event organized by the Physics Club of IISER-Bhopal. The event is a nigh-simulation of the Solvay Conference first held in 1911, devoted to outstanding preeminent open problems in physics. The Solvay Conference is part of a legendary tradition that has brought together Nobel laureates and other distinguished figures in physics.</p>
<p>The conference is specifically designed to provide an opportunity for students to network with their peers and engage in discussions on unrestrained and flexible problems. You get to indulge in critical thinking and problem-solving. We believe that this conference will be an incredible experience for students interested in physics. During the conference, you will have the opportunity to attend a talk by an eminent physicist, as well as participate in interactive sessions and quizzes. You will also have the chance to showcase your own research and ideas through poster presentations.</p>
<p><em>Mark your calendar from the 7th-9th of  April for the Model Solvay Conference. The conference is tailored specifically to students of all batches and will feature a range of exciting events and activities. These include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Presentation Conference</li>
<li>Poster presentations</li>
<li>Talk by an eminent physicist</li>
<li>Physics quiz</li>
<li>Movie Night</li>
</ul>
<p>We are glad to announce that the problem statement for the conference will be released on the 13th of March (Monday).</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong></p>
<p>This year's problem statements revolve around the physics of neutron stars and thermodynamics in an alternate universe. We cannot wait to see the innovative solutions that students will come up with.</p>
<p>Partake in this grand fiesta and take home fascinating physics goodies and cash prizes worth 20k!</p>
